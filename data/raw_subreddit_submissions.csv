If you are, would you mind sharing your data and experiences for my blog review?

I need to confirm a finding I've made.

I've been taking Qualia Mind for a month now (Yes I am affiliated with it, but I'm not using any affiliate links here) and my deep sleep has sky rocketed!

I used to sit around 15-20% deep sleep on a 8 hour sleep (based on oura ring data).

I've just finished a bottle of qualia mind (caffeine free) and i'm averaging over 30% deep sleep. Nothing else has changed. My highest night yet was 40% deep sleep.

I've just stopped taking it a few days ago, and I'm going to see what happens with my deep sleep - it will be interesting to see if it drops off or stays up for a while.

Full review and my findings will be published in the coming weeks.

For proof of the 40% scores see the bottom of this article - [https://www.alexfergus.com/blog/how-to-increase-deep-sleep](https://www.alexfergus.com/blog/how-to-increase-deep-sleep)

Barcode search never works offline but typing search and 'favorites' do in some apps. Only a handful of apps have time stamping. I have three options:

Write code over OFF or USDA database using Automate, IFTTT or Waistline. The database may be out of date but it will never cease to exist, require internet or spy on user. Unfortunately this will require lots of work. Waistline just added a few useful features.

Pay 40$ per year for mfp. Chronometer without offline logging is useless in too many cases. I would be willing to pay 40$ for this product but not 'per year' partly because its guaranteed to change or even die at some point. So no, not really.

Or just use bitesnap. This would be the easy choice, but OFF database is way more detailed and I am afraid of Terminator models with better food identification algorithms.

I hope this is the right sub for this question. 

I'm wondering if you know any companies, technologies or processes that might be able to help with the issue of hydration in mining environments. In the past, I have worked in the field (read: on a mine site or exploring for minerals), where it's common to work 12h shifts and you may be exposed to ambient temperatures of up to 50 °C (122°F) and it's surprisingly easy to forget to drink. On a hot day, you'd have to aim to drink between 5L and 10L, depending on your exertion level and when things get a little stressful it's easy to forget. The dangerous bit is that cognitive functions rapidly deteriorate but you aren't aware of it. 

I now work for a company bringing new technologies and solutions from other industries into the energy and resources and helping those companies get a foothold. We do this based on challenges from mining companies. I really like the most recent challenge around hydration monitoring, because I have experienced the effects myself in the past. 

Here is the full challenge statement:  [challenge link](https://unearthed.solutions/u/competitions/stay-hydrated) 

There are quite a few effects that make it challenging in a mining environment, such as long shifts, sometimes no toilet in the immediate vicinity, high temperatures, no to low internet connectivity, dust or dirt, etc. The focus is on how we can help individuals make sure they stay hydrated, not on how we monitor them. 

We are not just looking for wearables (which might be the first that comes to mind), but any type of solution that might help. 

Any input is welcome.",QuantifiedSelf,How to improve hydration levels and hydration monitoring in a mining environment,5,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/comments/bmg6j1/how_to_improve_hydration_levels_and_hydration/,self.QuantifiedSelf,{'t1_enn1fgk': Comment(id='enn1fgk')}

3. Two Days of Bad Sleep in a Row Will Mess. You. Up.
4. Weight Loss != Fat Loss
5. Carbs aren't evil. But they're... sneaky.
6. 15% body fat (for a guy) is doable with tasty food. 10% requires you to eat fewer tasty things. 5% requires you to forgo taste (and friends) entirely.
7. Muscles recover strongest 2-3 days after a workout, and stay stronger-than-baseline for about 2-3 days after that. Beyond that, wimpy-ness resumes and you atrophy. (Which is why consistency is key.)
8. Food Scales are your Friend. Casseroles, stews, and buffets are your Enemy.
9. Processed foods are easiest to track (because they have SKU's) but not as good for you. Whole Foods vs. Whole Data.

Hi guys.

I got approval to post this from one of the mods earlier and I hope to meet open ears with you as well.

More than 6 years ago (I was 18 to that time) I developed my first Android app which happened to be a blood alcohol calculator, partly because to that time I personally had the need for a proper app for that matter, LOL (I'm a German, you know...).

AlcDroid has been more or less popular in Germany, occasionally getting name-dropped in some German articles from newspaper media or whatever, especially recently when it came to New Year's Eve and everybody drank a bit more than usual. And even though Germany is not the only place where there's party at New Year's Eve and stuff, it is less popular in other parts of the world.

I just recently started to enhance AlcDroid to become more and more an overall alcohol consumption tracker rather than just a BAC estimator that you use once in a while at some party. I would love to hear what the more English-speaking community has to say about this (and I figured I might find some experts here, right?). This may sound a bit naive, since an alcohol testing app might be considered as rather simple and universal, but there are some things I did not always think too much about in practice, like units (fluid ounces and stuff), and while I have implemented those features in theory, I am not too confident about how they turn out in ""real life"".

It allows me to easily copy over all my data points, and has a TON of different options for doing statistical analyses etc. So far the most useful thing I've found is just the simple Graph Plot, but I'd like to figure out how to get more useful visualizations of my data. I have very little knowledge of statistics.

For example, how could I take my sleep quality, and see how each other variable affected it? If you're familiar with sleep cycle and how they show data correlation, that's exactly what I mean.

There are so many options to choose from in the application: univariate, multivariate, model, diversity, timeseries, stratigraphy etc, each with a dropdown menu of so many options.  I barely learned any statistics in school so any tips would be greatly appreciated.

* Sleep
* Diet
* Water

* Toilet
* Hygiene
* Mood
* Energy
* Pain
* Exercise
* Spending
* Ideas
* Activities
* People

I've been tracking all my expenses for the past 4 months. Since I only eat out, my eating habit and schedule can be inferred through my spending (i.e., I bought a burger therefore I ate a burger).

Until now, I've been using a spreadsheet to track things, but it's awkward and inconvenient to fill on my phone. I recently switched to a basic text-based journal, but I'm not sure if it's the best way forward. I still need to figure out how to process the inputs and add meaning to them.

I feel like food clearly has a huge impact on how we feel day-to-day. Some of these might be hidden medical conditions like not knowing you’re lactose intolerant or something, but I feel this is true of a lot of random foods I’m not actually allergic to, e.g. I always feel just slightly gross and inflamed after eating certain seafood, or my friends tell me they definitely have certain acne trigger foods. Why isn’t there a way for food / macro trackers to help figure out which foods are correlated with feeling meh -- without having to try and piece together these patterns ourselves, or doing a full-on elimination diet (I tried that for a bit, and eating parsnips for two weeks straight just \_sucked\_)?

I think I want to build something that can help me track how I feel during the day (and for me, whether I have skin breakouts) compared to just the ingredients in the food I eat, but I’m also wondering if maybe there’s already some good research or information about this that I couldn’t find yet. Most trackers just seem kind of suboptimal for finding these kinds of patterns + just so poorly designed (must it take 5 clicks to input a simple snack?).

If you want to try something like this too then sign up here to try the first version I make -- if more people would find this an improvement over what’s currently out there then I’m thinking of working on this for my software engineering project class this semester :) (sorry this page looks a little silly, I just wanted an email sign up option) [http://feedgoodhealth.strikingly.com/](http://feedgoodhealth.strikingly.com/)",QuantifiedSelf,"Do certain foods or macro ratios make you feel X during the day?

I get really into doing my stats and then I forget. So I want to create a persistent notification that can be expanded/collapsed and either has a manual list of each trackable that auto-links to the app or it would be cool to automatically pull out the whole list. Failing that, a notification with a manual list, with each item opening a separate app. So far I've found a way to create one notification that links to an app (but you have to expand the notification to see the link otherwise it just opens the notification edit screen.  
My second option is the same thing but as a widget. Anyone had experience with this? I've downloaded a couple of widget creators.  
Third option is to have some kind of list on the lock screen. Either a list that can be updated on the screen (so would probably need to be a feature of an existing tracking app) or a manual list like above.  
Final option is, if possible, to automate a reminder through a tool like Tasker, that will load my tracking app at a set time so when I open my phone after that, it will be the on-screen app. I'm new to automation so don't know if it can go as deep as actually loading up a specific screen within an app, but time will tell.  
I'm also toying with the idea of reminder email services. I could use a service like Typeform to set up my own although not sure if the data is syncable or shareable, but I've seen someone suggest using Zapier to zap the details to a Google Sheet, which can then be integrated into data pipelines.

These categories of experiences, which are largely qualitative (e.g. title of book read) rather than quantitative (e.g. pages read/ hours spent reading), include: the details of songs I learned to play on the guitar, details of books I have finished reading (generally grouped by the new technical domains I am interested in picking up), origins/ tasting notes of coffee beans I have made cold brew with, countries/ cities/ places of interest I have traveled to, restaurants I have dined at, names/ compositions of cocktails I have enjoyed, etc.

I am interested in a more structured and intuitive way of logging these experiences on a single common platform (ideally with beautiful UI), primarily for memory collection, but also to allow me to be more intentional about tracking the progress of my various interests/ hobbies. Given that no such platform exists AFAIK, I have decided to work on a little something to facilitate experience logging: [https://www.42quests.com/](https://www.42quests.com/) (currently only waitlisting is available to the public). I've tentatively labelled each category of experience as a ""quest"": for instance, the quest could be to master the guitar, and I'll log the guitar songs I have learned towards this Guitar Mastering quest.

I'm hoping to pick the community's brain for thoughts on this endeavor. Is this something useful for the quantified self movement? If you are interested in similar tracking use cases, what is your feature wishlist for the platform and what would you like to track? Any suggestions of other communities (whether on Reddit or otherwise) that might be interested in this, whom I can try reaching out to?

So far, I'm monitoring heart rate and galvanic skin response, but I'd be interested to know what else you all think I should measure?

The sensors are all esp8266-based, allowing me to send data via WiFi connections back to a central processing platform, so home brew is definitely an option (possibly preferred).

As this is the first year I am taking data collection serious, I don't have that much data. I only have the data from RescueTime, Toggl, a list of dates that I have meditated and the books I have read on Goodreads.

Just to give you an idea what capabilities I might need, what I am imaging is trying to make an area chart from the time data from RescueTime and Toggl (ideally with smoothing). I would then like to add the dates where I meditated (maybe as an box that is filled for each day I meditated) and the dates where I finished a book (maybe even with the book covers) below the area chart with the same date-X-axis.

What sorts of things would you advise for someone starting to get involved in this, who had the intention of building their own system to help with this?

&#x200B;

Thoughts so far - there are a lot of separate apps and resources for tracking specific things, like calorie and exercise trackers, productivity stuff, health and wearable devices etc, but I wanted to build something that aggregates the entire lot, and uses data analytics to try and draw interesting results if lots of areas of data were collected. I know some artificial intelligence, but it be possible with simpler stuff, I'll see how it turns out. I'll want to interface with it through an app / website, and I'm thinking of getting cloud server stuff for running the data collection, storage, and number crunching.

&#x200B;

Of course it'll be quite a large project, but the best thing about this topic is it's very modular, I can see immediate progress from hooking in an api from my calendar, or wifi connected scales that measure lots of different things somehow, or movement tracking software, one step at a time, and build up.

&#x200B;

Is anyone aware of any good open source projects doing something similar or that could include useful features for this? Even professional software that I can use for inspiration would be great.

Hello,

I've recently tried to quantify my study time and I am a newbie at all this. 

The beginning: 

Using Todoist Task Manager: I copied all my class assignments, test dates and study strategy into Todoist.

https://i.redd.it/nofmmdrxtqv11.png

Toggl: I had no way to quantify how many hours I'm spending on each task until I heard about Toggl. I was able to integrate with Todoist. So every time I start a task, I click on ""start timer"" (as seen above) in Todoiest and it would automatically calculate the time spent on my homework assignment and import it into the Toggl application (as seen below). Toggl will allow me to export this data in a .csv or .xls file. This is great! I'm making progress!

https://i.redd.it/o75i72pytqv11.png

&#x200B;

Here is where I run into trouble. With all this data collected, I want to visually see what I've accomplished, how much I've completed and see how much behind/ ahead I am in my class. The closest I can muster up is using a Gantt Chart I purchased on [Veretex42.com](http://veretex42.com/). I had to manually place the same tasks and due dates on my Todoist and as I progressed, I had to manually change the %Done field. The result was a fancy Gantt chart, but, there is so much room for manual error (e.g. incorrect copy & past of formulas), and there's so many steps to get what I want: I gantt chart or some variation of it.

https://i.redd.it/p0i292pztqv11.png

Does anyone have any suggestions? Do any of you know of an integration with Toggl that would provide me something similar to this gantt chart where it would show me visually how much ahead I am or behind I am?

Old model = symptoms i.e. disease has set in and is causing symptoms, condition based interview i.e. clerking, treatment i.e. side effects

New model = Predictive simulation (user data i.e. genetics, real time physiology tracking) + deep learning of clinical literature (artificial intelligence data mining) allows for predictive simulation and prevention, no disease, and a user-centric model (not a condition-centric one)

&#x200B;

To create a predictive model now one can string together the following:

\- Genetic data

\- Regular biomarker tracking (gold standard blood)

\- Real time physiology tracking

\- Utilise personal data and hope for an artificial intelligence deep learning of the entire clinical literature (IBM Watson etc). 

&#x200B;

Would a united consumer product that fuses the above be a breakthrough - it would dematerialise, democratise and decentralise preventative medicine and it would be user centric and personalised. A user interface allowing for easy understanding (potentially artificial intelligence natural language synthesis and voice interface would be good).

The key concept is as follows:

Subjective metrics (e.g. happiness) alone aren’t very consistent or reliable data points. Objective metrics (e.g. distance run) are great for statistical analysis but don’t yet exist for many of the things we care about. To get around that, we use markers or proxies of the things we care about. I argue that a combination of subjective and objective metrics is a powerful tool in gaining insights.

The latest version of my personal tracking framework has around 40 data points for both Subjective Productivity Rating (SPR) and for Deep Work hours.

On their own, neither is a very good indicator of how productive I’ve really been. SPR is subject to bias, flawed perceptions and the inherent noisiness of quantifying a psychological experience, whilst Deep Work hours are only a reference point for how productive I was. Both are great things to track individually, but together they allow me a deeper understanding of my perceptions and a glimpse at the underlying “true” productivity I’m achieving.

I am a Computer Science Student from Munich, Germany. I am currently working on my master's thesis, for which I helped to build an Android stress tracking app. The App works with all **Fitbit** and **Wear OS** devices that have a heart rate sensor.

Screenshots: [https://imgur.com/a/K2VtaSc](https://imgur.com/a/K2VtaSc)

Features:

*  Get real-time feedback of your stress levels via an Android App
*  Check out how your stress levels changed during the day
*  Keep a stress diary and connect your computed stress levels with your real world activities
*  See your current stress level at a glance with our stress complications (Wear OS only)
*  Measure your heartrates at adjustable intervals with a watch face (Wear OS only)
*  Fully customize the watch face with complications and colors

To evaluate the work I've done, I am planning a user study for which I am desperately searching participants with Wear OS smart watches.

The study will be running from 17th July to 31st of July. Participants are asked to use the app and regularly track their activities and feelings. This helps us to improve the stress detection algorithms.

For more information please visit: [http://stila.pms.ifi.lmu.de/news.html](http://stila.pms.ifi.lmu.de/news.html) . I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have here on reddit.

[Podcasts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) I use Podcast Addict. It shows how long I’ve spent listening to podcasts per day, month, year and list how long I’ve spent on each of the podcasts. However I don’t know if it takes into account the speed of the playback

[Tv shows]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fema.serietv2&hl=en) I use Tv series connected with Trakt.tv. Very easy to track the watch time.

Movies I do have some difficulties here as I’m only using IMDB.com to track my watch time. I think will have to look into some exporting data.

Movement tracked with Google Fit

Gaming time tracked with Steam, Origin and Uplay.

[Money tracker](https://moneylover.me/) with Money lover. Possible to export in Excel and create macros.

[Reading time]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flyersoft.moonreader&hl=en) tracked with Moon+ reader

***Exercise***. And now the biggest reveal. I track my exercises using Polar h7 HRM tracker (treadmill, workout, elliptical etc) and it syncs everything to Google Fit. Additionally, I track my food intake with Myfitnesspal that is synced with Google fit. So all 3 apps are interconnected :) BUT! There is no way of exporting data from MFP (as far I know. They patched all the scripts holes) so I use zenobase.com to export my synced google fit data. 
I can export how many calories did I eat (but not my macros….), what type of exercise I do and what’s my weight on a beautiful graph!

I hope I helped! If you have any suggestions please let me know :)

I have been using the device to help myself recognise tilt and negative emotions and which coping mechanism works. 

Postgame this is what my data looks like (https://imgur.com/a/4sANVdn). 
The yellow line is my BPM. I know what I'm doing during the early game so my heart rate is very consistent except for when I had my first death. I started performing some breathing exercises to help bring it back down again. 

The midgame and late game were very taxing, my heart rate would jump between 68-150. I tried using keywords and breathing exercises but by the late game I had forgotten and was totally tilted hence higher amount of deaths at the end. 

The green line is a function of HRV to try and model stress. It interesting to note that at ~27 mins they hit Baron and I knew the game was over and my HRV went under the bar(-negative is less stressed). 

Have anyone else measured their HR and made useful changes from the data? 

Any useful advice? 


**At 26 mins, I got tilted and threw my headphones which knocked the sensor hence why it skyrocketed to 220BPM.

I've been using the Moves app to collect my location data since 2013. It's been a good way for me to see my activity and, more importantly, where I have been over the years.

I linked the app with an app called Move-o-Scope that aggregates all of this data and shows it to you on a map - like so: https://imgur.com/a/GEZa3Da

Unfortunately, the service stopped working a while back (not sure why) and has not been updating for the past few months. 

This was a great tool for me to see my life map. Luckily, Moves have allowed users to export all data from the app but I have pretty much zero idea how to use it and would appreciate any help in getting this data in a format that looks like the Move-o-Scope. I've been messing about with TileMill but it's a little too complex for me and I'm not getting very far. I've managed to get my data imported (finally!) but I can't get it to look anywhere near as good as it did on Move-o-Scope and it certainly isn't interactive (i.e. looking at certain times, different activities, heatmap of places visited, etc.)

I'm sure most of you know/remember Seth Roberts. His theory of flavorless calories reducing hunger is still frustratingly untested (despite Eliezer Yudkowsky's admonition for scientists to ""get off their ass and test this thing already"") so I figured I would organize a group test of it. I'll let the late great Aaron Swartz summarize the theory here:

>“Your body stores up calories when food is abundant so it can use them in ‘lean years’, when food is scarce. So it would make sense for a person to be more hungry when food is abundant (allowing them to build up fat) and less hungry when it’s scarce (so they don’t feel hungry all the time).

>“The problem, of course, is that food is never scarce anymore. You can always just go to McDonald’s. The body is storing up for an eventuality that will never come. So how do you get it to stop? Maybe you could trick it into thinking food was scarce. This is where Roberts’s big insight comes —if we eat foods with little taste, our brain assumes we’re eating them because there’s nothing else around… A couple hundred calories of flavorless olive oil is the preferred suggestion.”

Rather than test weight loss (which is highly variable) we're studying the mechanism of hunger. There are more details about the design in the faq. Anyway, here's a link to the sign-up (which also links the faq and an explainer of Seth's theory): [plankify.com/satbasic](http://www.plankify.com/satbasic)

Regression is very interesting, but it doesn't differentiate between correlation and causation. I'm not planning to make any major decisions based on the results here, I'm more interested in which habits co-vary as well as how they change over time. I've only included things I do at least once a week.

List of explanatory variables:

- Fap
- Cardio	
- weights	
- anti-oxidants	
- cook	
- work	
- class	
- social	(seeing and talking to someone I have a longstanding relationship with)
- caloric deficit	
- bball	
- laundry	
- coffee
- study	
- shop	
- groom	
- alcohol	
- gluten	
- salmon	
- dairy	
- cocoa	
- weekend	
- apply jobs

List of outcomes:

 - Happiness
 - Anxiety

For tracking the variable will be a 1 for I did it that day a 0 for I didnt. Then a regression will explain the ""importance"" of each variable on the outcomes.

One interesting thing about regression is that explanatory variables can depend on and affect each other, for instance ""alcohol"" will usually be accompanied by ""social"" therefore its not entirely possible to disentangle their effects, so everything must be taken with a grain of salt.

Any other things that are important I could track? Any outcomes worth recording? I only have if I'm happy that day or if I'm anxious. I'd love to have more possibilities

Maybe just grab some highlighters from the dollar store so I can find each topic more easily, maybe something more complicated.

My current approach:

* Mini composition book, black ballpoint pen, kept in pocket or next to bed.
* Jot down every item as soon as possible after the event.
* Date on very left every time it changes, time (usually nearest half hour) one column over, actual items everything to the right of that. Horizontal line to separate each full night's sleep.
* Keeping track of: sleep/wake times, medications, vitamins and supplements, food (not calorie counting, just what and when), weight, exercise, anything unexpected but medically relevant, a couple of small daily things that I've noticed are proxies for my mood.

(I started on Nov 6, about 90 days ago, and have filled 60 pages out of the mini-book's 100.)

It's 2018. Is there no well-designed app that is able to serve as a unified hub for my tracking? Things, for instance, I think it should be able to do:

* detailed food tracking, or at least integration with the major food tracking apps (access to food databases is critical to the usefulness of MyFitnessPal, Loseit, etc., so I don't necessarily expect a non-specialized app to have all of that built in)
* built-in weather integration by location
* actually, basically any data you can gather by location should be possible to track automatically
* self-logging of any custom metric using a variety of data forms (e.g., should be able to enter data by selection from a list, sliding of a slider, numerical entry, text box, etc)
* integration with device apps and auto-logging apps like RescueTime
* actually, integration with as many other apps as possible
* data visualization
* a clean interface, hopefully


Does there exist anything remotely like this yet?

I'm just curious about your goals for data collection in the new year. Will you be tracking anything new? Focusing on any new goals? Quantifying anything different? Changing your tracking method? All that good stuff. 

For me:
More closely tracking the demographics of the authors and books I read (I want to read more nonfiction and more non-American authors).

Food tracking/water intake

More time tracking for just a general idea of how I spend my time during the year. My goal is to track at least 75% of my time in more general categories and maybe evolve to more specific categories later (like going from general social media to Twitter, FB, Instagram, etc.)

Fitness tracking/measurements tracking/workout tracking

My ground rule: everything needs to be able to be tracked with minimal effort, otherwise I will most likely let it go after the initial ""I'm so inspired""-phase has gone by.



I should mention one thing before I start: I don't really look for correlations. I use the data to find patterns and look back. I like to look at the old data and see if it corresponds with my gutfeeling about how I am doing. Almost like looking back in an old journal to see if it was like you remembered it, or to see if you've changed. So, I'm not trying to try any hypothesis. I'm just trying to look back and improve.



I use [Zenobase](https://zenobase.com) as a hub for all my data. Sometimes I look for correaltions, but mainly I use it as a fancy viewer. Great wesbite!




**What I track passively:**

- Movies/tv: collected with Trakt. I watch most shows and movies on Netflix, and with [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/traktflix-netflix-and-tra/bmoemkaigjgcgjjnpmdgkifndiidkeji?hl=en) plugin I can transfer my netflix history into Trakt.
- Music. [LastFM](https://www.last.fm). I listen mostly with the Spotify app, which can be connected and sync to LastFM (doesn't work with chromecast though!).
- Movement and location. Tracked with [Moves](https://moves-app.com/) (iOS).
- Computer usage. Tracked with [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/).
- Programming time. Tracked with [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com).
- Meditation. Tracked with [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com) (iOS, Android). They allow data export on their website. (I think this counts as passive tracking since it gets tracked automaticly by using the timer in the app).



**What I track manually:**

- Podcasts. I take a screenshot of all the episodes I listen to. With a workflow, these get moved into an icloud folder with the time and date as a title. I then manually log these into [Mark's great podcasttracker](http://www.markwk.com). Shoot him an e-mail and he'll probably help you out!
- Studytime. Tracked with [Toggl](https://toggl.com). I have one project for each class I'm taking. I track all the time spent on classes (self study, lecture-time etc.)
- Sleep. Tracked with the ios app [SleepCycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com).
- Money. [YNAB](https://youneedabudget.com) all the way. Great methodology and software! (And if you're a student you can use it for free for a year.)
- Pills/vitamins. App: [Medisafe](https://medisafe.com/technology/) (iOS). Wish they would allow export and Apple Health sync. I use this mainly as a reminders app.



**What I would like to track:**

- Reading time/pages read per day. I've found two good apps for this: [BookOut](http://bookoutapp.com) and [Leio](http://leio.co/?i=1). However, none of these seem to allow dataexport, BookOut dosn't have an iPad app and Leio won't sync between devices. So I won't use them. The ideal thing would be to use an ebook reader that has timetracking buildt in.
- Food. I used [Lifesum](https://lifesum.com) (iOS) for a week, but I stopped because they don't support vitamins (which I want, since I'm worried about not getting enough B- and D-vitamins). So I switched to [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com) (iOS, web). However, to import all the recipes/food I eat is very tiresome, so I've put the ""tracking-all-the-food""-project on hold.
- Alcohol. Tracked with the app [IntelliDrink](http://www.intellidrink.com). However, one or two beers in I always forget to track. I've put this on hold. Frankly, I don't really care about tracking this. But it can be fun to trying to get the ""optimal buzz"" sometimes. (""...such a geek!"")
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/index.html) (spaced repetition app). they have a lot of stats, but I can't export it. Wish I could integrate it with the rest of my nice looking graphs!
- [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) (checklist/projects app) stats. I've been trying to export the completed tasks as csv files to get the total of ""checked"" items per day but I don't really get it to work as conveniently as I'd like. If this is a feature you want, you could use todoist. However, I'm two deep in the omnifocus-mud and can't get away from all the fancypantsy feautres.


**Suggestions for the people that are just digging the list of software and want more:**

- [Nomie](https://nomie.io). (Duh).
- [Nice](https://appadvice.com/app/nice-sex-tracker/1107291612) (iOS). Tracks sexual activity. When I tried it I felt so dirty. I don't really track this. Haha. 
- [Reporter](http://www.reporter-app.com) (iOS) survey based tracker. Asks you questions.
- [Momentum](https://momentum.cc), the best habit-tracker/""don't break the chain""-app I've ever found. If they only had an iPad app...

Passive apps/devices tho, I love. What am I missing here that you know about?

Automatic: plugs into the serial port in my car, use IFTTT to log all trips and ignition on/off. All that is required is initial setup of device, and IFTTT setup with google drive.

Nokia Thermo: the easiest way to log my body temperature I’ve found. Put it in my bathroom, and just take a second to use it every time I’m in the bathroom.

iHealth Pulse Oxymiter: Also in my bathroom. Usually put this on when I’m taking my temperature with the thermo.

Nokia Body Scale: also in the bathroom. Get on this whenever I take a shower.

Whistle: track my dog’s activity. IFTTT to google docs

IFTTT iOS Contacts: add a row to google docs when I add a contact to my iOS contacts.

Apple Watch: Workouts mostly, and (passivley) too many other things to mention really. Also my access point for data from other devices like Thermo and the Body Scale.

Pillow iOS app: (with Apple Watch) to track my sleep

iHealth Glucometer: this is the most time consuming, but I take my fasting blood glucose every morning. I do not have diabetes... just keeping tabs.

Nokia BPM+: I actually don’t use this much at all bc of all the factors you really should take into account to take a proper BP measurement, but I’m working to try and incorporate this more. BP is more valuable than my blood glucose, for example, but it’s just more time consuming to do it right.

IFTTT for weather and all sorts of other things... write to google docs


Some day I will care to create a timeline of sorts with the years of data I’ve been collecting. Until then, the more I can passivley log, the better.

Any other suggestions?

Thanks

So what I would ideally like is a record of which apps I was actively using and during what time periods, and for apps that involve documents the name of the documents I had open, and whether I was reading them or editing them.  For Gmail, I would like a record of which individual emails I had open and for what time period, and whether I was writing them or only reading.  And for browsing I'd like a record of what URL was in the active tab for what time period.
  
I don't know if this is a tall order or not.  Having the exact information I described would be much more useful than the easier, more general form of record that tells things like, gmail was open in a tab from 1-4 pm (but not how much of the time I was using that tab, and which emails I was looking at when).  I am willing to go to a fair amount of effort to gather the detailed info, but of course I'm hoping there's a way to do it that's not too much of a nuisance.

All I currently need is a text record of the info I described. I don't need an app that will crunch the data, display it as a graph, etc.  I use a work Mac, a home Mac and and iPhone, all synced. I do all my browsing with Safari, and all my email with Gmail (using gmail by going to the Gmail site using Safari). I'm hoping there's some kind of spyware that employers use that I can use to spy on myself!  

I realize that to get the info I want I may need to look under the surface, so to speak, at files I don't usually look at.  If you are going to advise me to do that, please bear in mind that I am not a tech professional.  I am pretty fluent at using my computers and smart phone, but have no experience with rooting around in system files -- so if you tell me to do that, please spell out clearly exactly where I should look.

If an app didn't feed it a specific metric, you could log it directly. 

I moved to an Android phone, and it comes with Google Fit. Unless I'm missing something, Fit only stores steps, distance, weight, and calories. That's fine, but I'm looking for something as thorough and all-inclusive as Apple Health. I want to store as much as possible.

I want to run self-experiments such as a testosterone program. I take base-supplements - a multi vitamin plus D3 plus dig enzymes. I then want to take an extra supplement for a week and each day I want to journal plus add custom stats such as happiness, energy levels, sex drive, etc.

Ideally I'd like an Android+web synced app, however I will settle for just one if need be.

I can find tracking apps but they don't allow you to see what they relate to unless I give the stats very custom names.

I'm happy to forego the journaling or just do that separately.

Alternatively, if someone could recommend a stats tracker that allows stats to be grouped into 'folders', plus custom notes against each entry. I want to be able to compare multiple stats against each other, either through aggregated assumptions which I've seen done in one app that I can't recall the name of. It would say things like 'when it rains you stay go out less', in this case 'when you take supplement x your energy levels increase'. But a simple graph with multiple data sets would do.

A good colourful, modern UI would be great!

The desire here is to clear the fogginess of what/when/why coding in their behaviors and to analyze their own habits collectively and as objectively as possible. Unlike feelings, numbers are constant and can be manipulated to find answers to questions we have about ourselves as individuals. Sometimes this means showing ourselves that strongly-held beliefs are less real or true than we first thought. Other times the QS itself builds enough awareness of our behaviors to correct them (using MyFitnessPal to count calories, in so doing, eating less and losing weight simply because we’re looking more closely at it). 

The effectiveness of QS lies in the fact that numbers ARE king. They don’t lie, they’re (usually) not subjective, and they are consistent. 1 is 1, always has been, always will be. A number doesn’t get sad or take a day off, it is exactly as it states and because of that it can be used. We can move data to study when/how long we spend performing certain activities (Looking at you, Reddit!) and oftentimes shockingly discover how little time we spend studying in an average week and how MUCH time we spent on the Playstation in a month. 

Where the individual can excel is in taking responsibility for the data. Data doesn’t lie. If you’re not exercising, the data can tell you. It is then your responsibility, and no one else’s, to change that data. Not by lying to your QS Standing Protocol but by exercising. Assuming consistency of your Standing Protocol, the data changes, the outcome changes, but in reality what changed was YOU. Your reward isn’t just better numbers but a healthier body and a better quality of life.

So now let’s get down to the nitty-gritty.

In order for QS to be the most-effective and motivating, it must begin with a goal. Otherwise we are gathering abstract data for no reason or a just-in-case reason. Now, I recognize some people find value in this and take great comfort in it and that is perfectly fine. However, I am of the impression that the general population is interested in changing specific numbers and patterns. In most cases **the more precise the goal, the more precise the answer** because then we can tailor what data is collected and not have an overload of otherwise unnecessary data.

Secondly, QS is founded in the first word of its name. **The results must be a numerical value.** Even if the data is more abstract, such as a pain level, it should be recorded as a numerical value (1-10) so that it can be measured against your other numerical values. Your initial quantification of a non-numerical value may be lacking accuracy, but over time you will establish a greater degree of accuracy because you can relate it to your prior numbers. In the case of pain, your first day you may list a 10 but the second day the pain is even higher, in which case that is your new 10. As more values are entered, you can establish a greater feel for the relativity. Now, ideally, you’re measuring numbers to begin with (such as a blood glucose level) but if you’re not, it is still possible even if less than ideal.

Third, **The data is only as good as it is consistent**, so make an effort to track consistently. Missing data can be hard to replace. In the case of hormones, cortisol and insulin vary throughout the day based on behaviors, caloric intake, exercise, and the even less quantifiable Circadian Rhythm. So documenting weight at the same time every day (say, morning right after a shower) is more ideal than having some right after lunch, some before bed, and others “on a whim.”

Fourth, **Own the Answers**. If you’re doing the data collection right, being consistent, and the data correlates to your goal, take responsibility for the answers. Even if it’s uncomfortable, it’s better to know and not like it than to live in the dark. After all, if you don’t measure it, you can’t manage it.

Now, this is a nice little kickstart to QS and what it means but any Veteran QS-er is already going to be aware of these points. Where the QS community can stand to see the most improvement, in my own humble opinion, is in the Own the Answers element. I’ve seen a lot of frustration about the lack of technology/apps/insert_excuse_here and though I understand and share the sentiment, see little-to-no point in complaining unless the person complaining accepts responsibility to do something about it. I recognize this is a radical concept for some out there, but this is legitimately the only way something is going to change. If an app could stand to be tweaked or modified, contact the creators and write reviews or even write your own app. You can hire people to do this, actually, but it’s not cheap. However, crowd-sourcing and funding CAN be viable to create a solution with enough people on-board. As we move to solutions, we create an environment people want to join. One that is both emerging quickly, and very exciting. 

I simply believe that at this time the QS community can benefit greatly from both Standardizing For Newbies as well as Staying Solution-Oriented. The first to grow our community and the second because at its most basic level is a part of the QS culture.",QuantifiedSelf,QS: Owning the Answers (A Call to Action),6,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/comments/648bn6/qs_owning_the_answers_a_call_to_action/,self.QuantifiedSelf,"{'t1_dg0v4zv': Comment(id='dg0v4zv'), 't1_dgksaxl': Comment(id='dgksaxl'), 't1_dglc58r': Comment(id='dglc58r'), 't1_dgncwzy': Comment(id='dgncwzy'), 't1_dgb0xfn': Comment(id='dgb0xfn'), 't1_dgks64m': Comment(id='dgks64m'), 't1_dglvsdo': Comment(id='dglvsdo'), 't1_dgnd0ku': Comment(id='dgnd0ku'), 't1_dgkrxty': Comment(id='dgkrxty')}"

I have already spent an entire weekend switching my system and now I see holes in the desired outcome. I've looked online not alot of QS forums/active so hopefully you all can help out.

Background; So I'm a GTD'er..who gotten into QS data and combined that with a daily/weekly/monthly (DWM) review cycles.

The PERFECT app would be GRID Diary in which i had created custom templates aka questions for DWM reviews.
Examples: How many tasks completed, pomodor cycles, how long did I sleep, etc

The issue is lets say its 1 March - you can't have multiple templates for a day; so I can't use the daily & monthly overlays on the app which stinks.

So...I moved on to air table which i love its easy visual DB tool..however its still a bit cumbersome i have tabs in the app for month but than i realized I can't again have mixed DB fields for DWM questions...

On my list to test is google sheets/forms but just feels a bit clunky
I'm eyeing another iOS app for my ipad pro (primary computer) called Ninox full version is $15
Also thinking about DevON THink to go however I dont have a Mac so not sure how that would work..

The description for our study that was accepted is as follows:

*""Who controls the data from Quantified Self apps? The data from Quantified Self apps creates a new layer of complexity around agency, ownership, privacy and security of personal data in a Big Data world. Growth of the QS industry and community invites a deeper conversation about ethics in data collection, use, disclosure, who has agency over it, and how it’s shared for personal, commercial, political, etc purposes. It further invites exploration of what kinds of policies and practices create the best use and least abuse of QS data. The Quantified Self Report Card provides an opening for this conversation as well as a baseline measure for current privacy and security policies among a range of QS product providers.""*

Walter De Brouwer, CEO of Scanadu mentions here that their device Scanadu Scout can detect 5 vital signs blood presure, heart rate, temperature, pulse transit ans SpO2. https://youtu.be/H3AkSv0kf7Y?t=1507.

Unfortunately I dont their device is a wearable, so it cant do continuous monitoring. Also I heard they are de-commissioning their device in a few months.

I am curious to know if you know of any wearable or combination of wearables that can detect these signals simultaneously?

do you think that these metrics are good enough to provide a good picture of your general health?

Thanks

I created a spreadsheet tool for tracking your energy levels throughout the day, along with libido and mood, and correlateing that with what you're eating, doing, etc, then showing the results in a graph.  

I've been testing it with a few friends, and in a week or two I plan to start a big study where I have hundreds or thousands of people- redditors, readers of my blog, or whoever's interested- fill it out for at least a week and then submit it to me anonymously. Then after I have at least a few hundred of them, I'll mine the data for insights, with the help of some of the data wizards here on reddit, and share the results and insights with everyone.  

I've refined the sheet a fair amount over the past month, and I could use some feedback on creating the final version that I release to the pubic. Take a look: 
[Numbers version](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2UFYjEW_FEGWnIzVnl5RHM4UUE)
[Excel version](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2UFYjEW_FEGZXhNTTd2Nno0N1U)

Now I really need advice on how to make this easier to use, and more useful. And specifically:

Are any of the instructions unclear or insufficient?

Do you like how I've defined every value for energy, mood and libido?  

Any other rows or columns I should add or variables I should track? Was thinking of adding one for ounces of water consumed, or a row at the bottom to add up total food/caffeine consumption, but I'm open to other ideas too.

Is there a second chart I could add in addition to the one I have that would be useful?

Does the Excel version display well?  And do I need to create a separate Google Spreadsheet version?  I don't have Excel and have never built one in Google.  

If I collected hundreds of these, could people aggregate them to crunch the data?  Any design changes that would make that easier?

I want something (could be a mobile app or a dedicated device) to track my location permanently. Like what Sport Trackers (Endomondo is the one I used) but not with a focus into sports activity but into location.

This is something I wanted to exist since I was 15 years old when I bought a Garmin Etrex Legend handheld GPS.

I'm 30, not working because I sold my startup and planning to travel to travel with my bicycle around the world.

I'm using Moves but it's far from what I would like, you can't set a really good accuracy and since it was bought by Facebook now the focus is very far away.

I see this question could fitted better in the Lifelogging subreddit but besides it was active in the past, it's pretty much dead right now.

I'm somewhat sure that there's not an app that does what I want and I'm planning on funding the development of an open source one that makes it. There was a company called ARO that made Saga but the went bankrupt and the team is all dispersed.

Any idea, advice or suggestion is appreciated. Expressions of interest in the field are also welcomed.

I'm xposting this from /r/Diabetes, and it's targeted at any T1 diabetic individuals here at /r/QuantifiedSelf.

I've got a weird request. I'm a masters student, and I'm focusing on machine learning and data mining in my final semester and I want to do a cool project regarding T1DM.

I would like to try and create a model that predicts blood sugar for one particular patient using as much blood glucose, insulin, carbohydrate and maybe exercise data as I can get from them. This has been tried before with varying degrees of accuracy, but I think they've made some mistakes and that it could be done better.

I'm asking the internet because this isn't with grant money or anything, or for a thesis. It's just a class project, and it would be completely anonymous and unpublished - just to see if it can be done and get some practice and try a few things that I think previous attempts missed or did poorly. The data I'm picturing is hard to find online and I think it would be more interesting if it was genuine and not some random overused set from UCI in 1994.

Then, if that model's error isn't massive, I would build a few visualizations of it, possibly interactive, which I could share with whomever shared their (depersonalized) data with me. (with the large caveat that it is just for fun and can not be used clinically of course)

So what I am requesting is some tables. Blood glucose readings and times/dates(preferably exact), insulin units, times and type, carbohydrate consumption and times (and maybe other nutrition data) and possibly exercise time/type/duration and potentially calories consumed.

If anyone is very dedicated to keeping records of their data and would be interested in sharing.. pm me and we can talk about ensuring it is depersonalized/anonymous. I would be extremely appreciative. I know pumps and meters keep some of this, I am hoping to meet someone who keeps intricate records, of course, as more data means a better model, though would be happy with a few months of bg/carbs/insulin amounts and times. (and I'm probably restricting it to one person to remove the inter-individual biological variability, though that may change). In return you would have my sincere gratitude and get to see a cool predictive(and hopefully interactive) chart of your data and the model.

Does anything like this exist?

The real point of QS is to not do QS - or at least much less actively. It's similar to the exercise of meditation by monks and those types of guys back in the day. The more you see your biofeedback loop reaction function, the more you understand your input/output dynamics, the more intuitive your life optimization decisions become. Short term, why do people stop using their wrist bands as much? They realize they don't walk enough every day, so they can pretty much check that box mentally without having to look at the data. The trick is to set the QS whole body optimization target/goals very, very high, so that it will take a lot of time and practice to get there, and once you're there, you're ridiculously I tune with the proper functioning of your body.

In particular, at the moment I struggle to choose software which could help me to generate and test hypotheses from the data (I don't want to do it by hand = with excel). Is there a specialized piece of software that would do that? Or should I go for the general and complex tools like R?

> Changes in mood that occur normally in daily life are widely believed to affect the function of other psychological faculties – in particular, the one of cognitive ability. Only 5 previous studies tested this theory using a micro-longitudinal study design, which sees participants repeatedly assessed on mood and cognitive function over the course of several days or weeks. Unfortunately, the studies' findings are inconsistent and inconclusive, mainly because they assessed small samples on few occasions in controlled (i.e. lab-based) settings.
> 
> To address this issue, the smart-phone application moo-Q was developed, which allows repeatedly assessing large samples on mood and cognitive function in natural settings (i.e. experience-sampling method). moo-Q is freely available for download from the Apple store. It prompts users at random times during the day to complete brief measures of positive and negative affect, as well as three quick cognitive tests of processing speed, working memory and short-term memory. All measures were validated in preliminary lab-based studies.
> 
> Since its launch in August 2015 until January 2016, moo-Q was downloaded 24,158 times in 155 countries across the world. 69% of the sample identified as male. Reported ages ranged from 18 to 118 (mean = 31.44 years, SD = 10.10). 15,182 people completed moo-Q once, and 704 people completed moo-Q ten or more times. Latent class growth analysis could not detect systematic group-level heterogeneity in mood and cognitive function over the course of a day (e.g. morning/evening types). Also, neglidible coupling effects between changes in mood and changes in cognitive function were identified.
> 
> The results suggest that changes in mood that occur normally in daily life do not notably alter cognitive function, confirming the stability of inter- and intra-individual differences in cognitive performance. Furthermore, the study illustrates the utility and limitations of smartphone applications for collecting complex trait data on cognitive ability from extremely large samples across countries

Maybe an app somewhere works, but I have had no luck in finding one. Anyone has any suggestions? I use Windows 10 Mobile (I know, don't need to hear it), so some of the popular apps don't apply, unfortunately.

I've tried lots of android apps and not found anything quite right. I can picture what I want but can't code at all. I've been into quantifying for a year or so, but may have missed a really obvious solution

I want to collect data on lots of different topics and compare it (so I can see on a graph, for example, my productivity and the number of cups of tea I've had, and calculate the chance that tea improves/worsens my productivity, or whether one factor, like whether I take my medication or not, alters, for example, the length of my commute.

I'm open to an android or web based solution, I can pay a bit but not lots. Any ideas?

ETA: I know the statistics bit is harder to do and I'm less likely to find it on an app, but if the app lets me show graphs with 2 or more of the things I'm tracking and download the data so I can do the statistics bit myself I'll be happy",QuantifiedSelf,Best way of collecting numerical data on lots of topics and comparing it / graphing it / performing statistical operations on it?,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/comments/4neww2/best_way_of_collecting_numerical_data_on_lots_of/,self.QuantifiedSelf,"{'t1_d43xulp': Comment(id='d43xulp'), 't1_d43e48l': Comment(id='d43e48l')}"

But, as you all know, there is just so many aspects of life to be quantified and measured! So, we would love to get your help by filling out a short survey that lets us know what you're interested in tracking, and what you're interested in trying to actively change.

After being frustrated with how difficult it can be to get your own medical data, and how confusing the results are, including countless stories of misdiagnosis, we've been piloting a service to help patients get all of their medical data, from all their doctors, as easily & intuitively as possible. We've been running the service for a small group of paying customers, but now we've dropped out price to free for a limited time being to start helping more people get their data for free: https://checkapollo.com

We believe that everyone should be an active, educated participant in their own healthcare. When it comes to Quantified Self, it seems to us like it's strange that we have our Photos, Location, Financial Data & Wearables data on our phone, but out core health information is so hard to access.

If we can communicate to providers & insurers that people want to have access to their data, that they want to be engaged, then they'll start to listen & engage their patients actively as well. We'd love to hear from the community whether this service is helpful to you & what you want to be able to understand about the data / in which ways you want to use it. One of our big assumptions is that people want to connect with others who are experiencing similar ailments to be able to discuss the data of their lab results in an easy way online. The ability to automatically get a second opinion from another doctor, the community, or a digital diagnosis tool, seems promising.

Please sign up and let's start communicating to the industry that the demand for this type of service is here. Let us know your thoughts on what would be useful and how we can help. I'm hoping that this doesn't come off as promotional, as our aim is to engage the community to understand if this service we're providing is useful & how we can make it most helpful to you.

&nbsp;

I really want to start keeping track of my life and collecting useful data about myself. I'm trying to decide on a good wearable and at this time I'm considering the **Basis Peak** to be the only wearable that fits my criteria. The only thing that I don't like about it is the interface.

&nbsp;



I need to reliably collect granular data of:

- Resting HR
- My sleep quality/movements

&nbsp;

I also need the watch to be:

- able to connect to external (chest) HR monitors (for when I'm doing HIIT - can't rely on the wrist HRM)
- able to quickly see the output of said external HRM while running (hence needs to be a watch of some kind)
- waterproof to some extent (showering/ shallow water swimming etc)

&nbsp;

I really like the **Garmin fenix3** but it doesn't seem to reliably collect RHR data.
I've also seen the various **fitbit**s but they don't connect to external HRMs and aren't very waterproof.

I believe if it's our goal to improve in something that is subjective (have a better attitude, be more motivated) - we often must track measures that are inherently more subjective. Even though there is some sacrifice in data quality, I think it's better than less relevant but objective data points (like steps).

It takes a very data driven approach to weight loss trying to smooth out the day to day bumps in scale measurements by using something called an [exponential moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing). This is great when you are in the midst of losing weight, but I don't think it's the best for projecting into the future and setting reasonable goals 3, 6 or 12 months down the line.

If you spend time on /r/personalfinance you've probably come across the website [FIRECalc](http://www.firecalc.com/), which projects your future assets based on historical market data.

I wanted to take the spirit of the hackers diet (use some math to tell if you are on track, and if you go off track eat less) and the methodology of the FIRECalc and apply them to weight loss and long term goals.

My final product was this [chart] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qib0353Iq39zkqILZfpLQEI3seqOPDGSXmAsdPNYewk/pubchart?oid=2059246661&format=interactive) which takes my current weight and creates many potential future trajectories based off of my daily difference in weight. To bias it towards recent measurements, the sampling is biased exponentially towards recent measurements.

Concretely, all trajectories start with my current weight: 220lbs.

Then based on the deltas between recent measurements, I project my weight for tomorrow, taking 220 + x where x is sampled from [ -2.9
1.95
-1
-0.95
-0.7
-0.2
1.7
-0.15
-2.55
1.05
-0.6475
0
-2.7525
2.37]

This process is then repeated to project my weight in 6 months. I can then say that based on recent measurements, I have a 50% chance of weighing 200lbs in Febuary. If I were to start eating poorly, this projection would start to flatten out (or go up), because more recent measurements are more likely to be selected than old ones.

The nice thing about this approach is that it doesn't assume anything a priori. It doesn't assume that ""you can only lose 2 pounds a week"", or that I intend to eat at a 500 calories deficit. It is simply based off of my behavior and what the scale says.

To make it easier, I have a withings wifi enabled scale and hook directly into google spreadsheets using [ifttt](https://ifttt.com/).

You might also be interested in the exponential moving average (and second order exponential moving average) [chart of my weight  in 2015](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qib0353Iq39zkqILZfpLQEI3seqOPDGSXmAsdPNYewk/pubchart?oid=1944033497&format=interactive).

Why ... to help people find more fulfilling relationships and friendships through science. Introducing Biometric Match.
 
Biometric Match is the world's first Biometric social network. It uses an emotion-based facial cue system (powered by Affectiva) which maps users emotions, physical reactions and perceptions to specific visual stimuli. This stimuli, in the form of short video clips, helps us create a true portrait of self - far more accurate than a list of random questions. Now you can find out what a person feels and get to know their true personality before you ever meet up.
 
We just rolled out a new Kickstarter campaign to help speed up development of this groundbreaking social experience. See more at

- Very customisable trackers: allows you to create trackers with textboxes, numeric values, yes/no, multiple choice, sliders, tickboxes etc and allows you to create custom formulas using other data within the tracker. 
- I guess it works most similarly to a spreadsheet but it has several features which make it better suited for self-tracking e.g. each entry is automatically tagged with time/date, it's lightweight and quick to use, formats automatically for numerous variable types, some in-app data visualisation, etc

The purpose of this study is to learn about what motivates people to start and continue to track their exercise, diet, sleep, stress, or weight, and how self-tracking helps them reach health goals. The study consists of a brief interview and questionnaire. Participants will receive compensation for their time.

But I don't know how to do advanced filtering and the zenobase website doesn't offer too much info in this regard (or my google skills are not that good :) ). 

I'm able to set the simple filters for the scatter plot: tag:Heart Rate and tag:sleep but the results returns the correlation between the avg. heart rate during the previous day and the sleep efficiency. I would like to add another filter to the heart rate data, in simple words that would be: ""the average heart rare during the sleep period"". Is that possible?

- resting HR is useful, but only really on a day-timescale (not minute by minute). I already get a daily HRV measurement
- wrist based HR sensors measure pulse, not heart rate anyways

Perform random checks during the day: Put the Polar H7 on, add a tag or two, perform a measurement. Again, if I can then upload the data to Google Fit or Jawbone UP that would be even better :)

1. Import data from other services (such as the auto logging tools on Android) (Nice to have)
2. Allow me to manually input custom trackers (Must have) with several different tracking options (numbers, yes/no, etc)
3. Allow good reporting, ideally I'd like to visualise patterns, something a little more sophisticated than just charts
4. Ability to receive emailed questions or similar to pull in data (nice to have)

I'm happy to have two tools, one to add the data and another to analyse them.

What's the closest tool? I was testing i.strive.to today but the reporting was horrible. Also tried askmeevery which allows you to ask questions and then connect the data to statwing but statwing want 50/month which even they recommend for something higher than personal use.

**What is this?**

* A simple way to just start tracking daily activities and most important tasks and get some feedback out of it.

* There are 4 custom categories, some (very simple) sleep deficit tracking and 3 most important tasks.

* You can assign points for each task on row 6 and for each category a daily score will be calculated

* Bonus: [graph](http://imgur.com/mvwE9QE)

**How to use**

* Fields A to K have formulas and have to be dragged down when adding a new entry.

* To add new columns in a category just insert a new column but make sure it's added inside the category and not at the extremes of it. For example to add one to AAA, adding it between O and P would be ok. Adding it between P and Q would break the formulas.

We are three master students from Copenhagen Business School, who are in the middle of writing a thesis on the subject of Quantified Self.
The main focus of the research is on how the future organization will be impacted by the QS movement, and how individuals/employees will be impacted by HR departments' use of quantified measures. We would very much appreciate it, if you could help us by completing this survey - It will only take a couple of minutes (mostly radio buttons).
The survey will help us achieve knowledge about people's awareness and use of self tracking and self measurement. 

Link to survey: https://survey.enalyzer.com/?pid=rs6n5rip

I'm looking for a way to track my heart rate continuously.
I don't think that there are cheap solutions which could compete with a medical ECG, but there might be tracking devices (special applications), which could recognise cardiac arrhythmia. I just want to keep track of these and my daily average heart rate - mainly for medical reasons.

I found the Mio Fuse. This one can track the heart rate continuously but I don't know how precise this one is and if I could wear it every day (it looks very big) but I think this might go in the right direction.
It should be wearable on the wrist.

Maybe someone in here uses a heart tracking device for a similar purpose? If you got any advice or read anything about a device (?!) which could help me I would appreciate it very much!

I'm aware that if I want a real medical quality device I would have to pay very much for it, but I just wanted to ask if someone gained experience in tracking the heart rate, not only to keep track of your daily activity but rather in a medical way.",QuantifiedSelf,Best continuously heart rate tracker (especially for cardiac arrhythmia),7,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/comments/3364tn/best_continuously_heart_rate_tracker_especially/,self.QuantifiedSelf,"{'t1_cqhw5ii': Comment(id='cqhw5ii'), 't1_cqp7onx': Comment(id='cqp7onx')}"

However, there are too many options and they all seem too promising for me to figure out which is the best for each of the following:
    

1. Heart rate throughout the day (doesn't have to  be incredibly accurate, but consistency in its inaccuracy is a plus)

2. Heart rate during activity (the more accurate and less likely to fall off/get in the way of weightlifting the better)

3. Sleep. I'd prefer something that automatically detects I'm asleep. However, if the best trackers are not wearables, I'm fine with setting them up. It has to be able to work with multiple people in the same bed. 

4. Weight. I'm leaning toward the Fitbit aria because it would be nice to have weight and bf% automatically recorded
5. General activity tracking (steps taken, stairs climbed, steps run, time spent being active)
6. Something like an eeg (not continuous)

Other requirements: For all of these, I would like to be able to retrieve my data. I'd like to have only one device on my wrist at a time. I also prefer a screen over having to pull out my phone.

Other questions:
Is there an appreciable difference in sleep tracking quality between the UP3 and the Fitbit charge hr (that is, does the UP3 actually track different stages accurately and is that something worth measuring)? How do smart watches like the Moto360 and the apple watch compare to, say, the fitbit charge hr for the activity tracking portion? Are there other biometrics I should be measuring and if so, what's best for those measurements?

I'd prefer a single device, but don't mind having more than one if the data is better. I was leaning toward apple watch + some sleep tracker, or fitbit surge (although I don't love it as a smart watch)/ fitbit charge hr by itself to cover some of the above.

I work on [Ginsberg](https://www.ginsberg.io), a project based in Edinburgh, Scotland that is exploring improving mental wellbeing through new technologies. 

We released a new app last week called [Activity & Mood Diary](https://www.ginsberg.io/activity-mood-diary-app/) that allows users to track their mood and emotional wellbeing, record physical data (sleep, alcohol consumption, steps, nutrition etc) and create diary entries. The app is designed to help people spot connections between their moods and their physical activity and identify triggers for stress and low mood.

You can download the app at the links below, or there's also a web version. Windows Phone and Blackberry versions are in development but no ETA as yet.

* [Activity & Mood Diary for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/activity-mood-diary-by-ginsberg/id973390854?mt=8)
* [Activity & Mood Diary for iPhone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scotgov.ginsberg&hl=en_GB)

We'd be really interested in getting feedback from the community on the app. That said, please bear in mind that it's aimed at a more general audience than the QS hardcore and several features (sleep tracking, exercise, nutrition) won't be as sophisticated as you will get in dedicated apps.",QuantifiedSelf,Activity & Mood Diary by Ginsberg - new mood tracking app for iOS and Android,8,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/comments/300519/activity_mood_diary_by_ginsberg_new_mood_tracking/,self.QuantifiedSelf,{'t1_cpoxdr5': Comment(id='cpoxdr5')}

I didn't plan on making it public at first, but if enough people are interested, I'll put more work into it and release it on the app store.

After using spreadsheets for a long time to track all sorts of stuff, I started to look for an app that would make this easier for me. For some reason I didn't really like any of the habit tracking apps out there and I guess I was just used to the spreadsheet feel with the grid an cells, so I made my own app. I've been using it for couple of months now and I'm just interested if anyone would be interested in using something like this.

The idea is that it's like a spreadsheet table and you edit entries by just clicking on the cell and each cell has its own data type for simpler entry, like time, Yes/No, number, text, predefined options, etc. Depending on the entry, it turns green of red. And you can add a note to each cell as well. Columns for each day are added automatically and the App icon badge displays number of untracked entries for today.

As a part of this project, we have developed the Android application MoodTraces (http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/tod/MoodTraces.html), a mobile phone application that periodically samples the location of the user and ask him to reply to a short daily questionnaire (less than 1 minute to complete). The collected data will be used to study the relationship between the mobility behaviours and the emotional states (e.g., mood, stress, depression) of the participants. The study has the full approval of the Ethics Review Board of the University of Birmingham.
We would like to invite you to take part in this study by downloading MoodTraces directly from Google Play at:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nsds.moodtraces

Participants who download the application in their phones and complete the daily questionnaire at least 50 times over a two month period, will be entered into a 
draw to win a Nexus 5 mobile phone and five £10 Amazon vouchers.

It's this device called the Versus that's designed to improve focus, stress management, impulse control and the speed with which you recover from mistakes, and ultimately help you get into a flow state.  

I'll be posting updates once or twice a month about my progress with it.  Aside from using it for its intended purpose and ultimately writing up a review, I also want to try using it under different conditions to see how that changes my readings- like with a blue light shining in my face, or in darkness, or using it while taking various nootropics. So I'm open to any suggestions people have for me about different tests I could run with it.  

To be clear, it comes with a suite of exercises that you play while wearing it (using a companion iPadd app), so I think the conditions need to be something that can be in place while playing the iPadd games, so nothing like ""take readings while kayaking"" or anything like that.  Anyway, I'm open to suggestions, and if anyone's interested in following along, you can read about in on [my blog,](http://johnfawkes.com/becoming-superhuman-through-diy-brain-scanning/) join my mailing list (I'll send out updates about 2-3 times a month), or just check in a month or two and see what I've posted to reddit about it.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/25eaab/very_weird_guy_right_here/) is the original post.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3_X-eEw14T-dGRONXlvMVZoWEE/view?usp=sharing) is the link to the template.

Some of the things I've changed:

* The formulas in the percentage conversion tab are a little longer but now there's not a million different cells needed to calculate these (I didn't break the formula up into different cells this time).
* Each variable has its own tab now for it's specific breakdowns. Formerly, it was all on one tab. This makes it easier to see and more pleasing to the eye.
* Adding new eras under each variable in the Setup tab is much easier now because the Data Validation in the Data Entry tab now covers all the empty spaces. Now the user doesn't have to mess around with Data Validation unless they exceed the number of cells I already provided.
* In the Data Entry tab, the ""year"" column autopopulates after you enter in the new year in January.
* In the Dashboard tab, I've added a column for w/l streak as well as the cumulative win/loss and cumulative win percentage column.

I've really enjoyed sharing this with Reddit and have enjoyed talking with other people who are interested in this concept so if anyone has suggestions or feedback I'd LOVE to hear it.

By the way, I do have a template for this new version so if anyone is interested please mention so in the comments.

I'm working on something that can help quantify and track important mental metrics like: quality of life, stress, satisfaction, and burnout. I'm thinking it is important to provide an overall score and graphs of important metrics over time, with a burnout alert to catch it before it gets too bad. I work with a lot of case managers and social workers in very high stress environments, and I think there is a great model for taking care of yourself and tracking your mental states over time. This has been very helpful to me and could be really helpful to many others. I hope this could provide a layer of information to make improvements and understanding how energy levels and motivation change over time. I want to make this super easy and simple to track with a few minutes each day but get some really substantive and useful metrics with tools and tips to make positive changes.

* increase productivity
* improve sleep
* improve mood
* lose weight

It pretty much could be anything. But then I would set up integrated tracking for that person, I would rent them the appropriate tech. And integrate it into the cloud so I could personally track.

I'm trying to rework what data I'm collecting so that it would be flexible and useful for analysis. 

At the moment I'm trying to rework how I track mood and am hoping I could get some idea of how you guys track different data too. Previously I tracked mood by choosing a category to answer the question ""How do you feel?"" with the following answers: amazing, good, neither good nor bad, good and bad,  bad, awful. It was limited and not very representative of actual mood so I've been looking at psychology books to see how they classify mood and emotions. 

I don't feel like reinventing the wheel but am hoping you guys can chime in with what apps/sites you use to track, what you track, and specifics about how you track it. If you use an app please describe how it tracks particular things out of the box or how you've tweaked it to your needs. 

I used Tickmate for Android and am currently using KeepTrack Pro. Below is what I have. 

Mood:
Reminded at specific intervals to record moods. 
Transitioning to tracking via a -5 to +5 scale based on if I feel positive or negative and same scale for energetic or lethargic. Trying to figure out if this is the best way

Sleep:
Tracked manually with a reminder notification that I need to enter data. 
Record time I go to bed, and how long I sleep, record dreams if I remember them. 

What I drink:
Record how many cups of tea I've had and how many cups of coffee. Timestamp records when I drink. Don't record the type of tea, but I should. 

Illness:
Record who in the family has been sick. Don't really have a good idea on how to track specifics such as type illness or severity. 

Fights or disagreements:
Just a yes/no response type, it's a holdover from a previous app that only allowed me to track yes/no but I want to change to track severity and positive or negative outcome.

Sex:
Track the type but thinking I should probably track outcomes as well. Time stamped to track when it happens.

Android already has good pedometer apps that run in the background (like Accupedo and that Samsung Pedometer app), all day long, every day, but they don't also track sleep time.

Basically, for 6-7 hours every night the phone is completely motionless and charging. That would be easy to log and non-invasive. Being non-invasive leads to better chances of capturing data year-long and analyzing trends.

I am working on the next version of my iPhone app, [Quantifier](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quantifier/id700329187?mt=8), and I am in need of a handful of new beta testers.
The app is for tracking your personal data. It can be used to track your weight (as a replacement of the now-defunct WeightBot), to track your daily steps using the iPhone 5S's M7 coprocessor, or any other numerical data you would like to track over time. You can see what I use it for in the screenshot linked below. You can easily export your data for analysis, and backup files to Dropbox automatically.

If you are interested in helping out with beta testing, please DM me your [iPhone's UDID](http://bjango.com/help/iphoneudid/) and an email address that I can send the betas. If you aren't interested in testing software but the app sounds interesting, please check it out in the App Store and wait for the new version! It should be just a few weeks away.

Feel free to get in touch with me via DM if you have questions, feature requests, etc.

***

We are a research team from George Washington University, and we're seeking volunteers to track their sleep patterns using an Android app called ""Drowzy"". The app was developed by two clinician researchers: a board certified psychiatrist, and a sleep medicine specialist. The primary focus of Drowzy is measuring sleep efficiency, which specialists generally agree is the most important measure of sleep quality.

Sleep efficiency is the ratio of time asleep to time in bed trying to sleep. Researchers have found that sleep efficiency is strongly linked to satisfaction with both nighttime sleep and daytime wakefulness. Sleep efficiency appears to be even more important than the total number of hours slept.

Entering data into Drowzy takes less than 1 minute per day. The app provides:

Graphs of sleep efficiency and satisfaction.

Tabular displays of detailed sleep data.

An option to email data and graphs to a doctor or therapist.

The ability to download all your data formatted as a CSV file (spreadsheet).

Evidence-based recommendations on improving sleep.

Specialized key pads that allow data to be entered fast.

***

Our goal is to gather data from thousands of people so we can better understand:

How sleep is influenced by age, gender, medical illness, bedroom environment, latitude, and the presence or absence of a bed partner.

How seasonal changes affect sleep. What is the effect of latitude differences?

How daylight savings time affects sleep.

The relationship between sleep efficiency and satisfaction in a broad population sample to compliment the smaller studies that have already been published.

As data begins to accumulate, additional analyses will included. We would be grateful for suggestions from people who have used the app, and are familiar with the data being collected. Our contact information is on the Drowzy app download page on Google Play.

Although insomnia affects millions of people, and has been associated with psychological problems, increased blood pressure, and even heart attacks, sleep still remains a mystery. With a critical mass of people contributing to this study, we will be able to assemble a large database that will help shed light on this essential aspect of human behavior.

This is an experimental offer and I'll probably charge 5x more for this to body hackers next go-round.

HERE'S THE DEAL:

I'll take your .csv or Excel sheet or Google Spreadsheet of data you've tracked and run it through a Pivot Table and do a Multiple Regression analysis in Excel's Data Analysis add-on. 

You might be interested if you've tracked numbers in the past but struggled to interpret what they mean or act on them (e.g. the reason Fortune 500 companies pay shit tons to data scientists). 

I'll give you a report with a short explanation of significant correlations (>.95 p value) on variables that are quantifiably affecting your mood, productivity, energy, or performance.

e.g. ""In your data, increases in your mood were most highly correlated with increases in X, Y, and Z and negatively correlated with increases in X, Y, and Z. 

You can send me a spreadsheet of data you've tracked in the past, or grab a spot and start tracking today. Here's a spreadsheet I use for accurate analysis you can copy if you want:

Last year I began working with a super-talented team on a project that is very close to my heart. We began with a single question that grew into a mission and spawned a company. That question was: how do you quantify your mood and energy? That eventually grew into a mission to help make the quantified self movement more about your decisions and habits, and less about the numbers.

I'm proud to introduce to the Reddit community the Lume Personal Tracker. Think of it as a data-driven journal that's designed to help you visualize your mood and energy. Use the simple and intuitive interface to record mood and energy data. Add a text entry to give your data an additional layer of meaning and context. Motivate yourself to track regularly by setting daily, weekly, or monthly goals. Take a moment each day to reflect on your well-being, and record it using Lume. The more you record, the easier it is to see trends in your behavior.

Lume is FREE and available for devices running iOS 6 or later.

Since this is version 1 for us, there was some functionality that we had t o leave on the cutting room floor. However, we will continue expanding the app’s utility with forthcoming updates. Users can look forward to several new key features that will enhance their experience with the app:

* Add location data to a journal entry
* See your journal entries on the graph view
* Set “Checkup” alerts and reminders to track
* Expanded graphing and visualizations
* Backup, export and sync your data.

Further updates will include additional modules for tracking various aspects of your fitness, such as diet, weight, and activity tracking (running, cycling, step counting).

This is an attempt to provide a holistic approach to health - one that takes into account mental health in addition to physical health. Download Lume and help us improve our understanding of personal health.

Thanks so much for your help!

And excel annoys me.

Recently I discovered that Microsoft is giving away Visual Studio free and I've been working on an app to help me with music production.

It just occurred to me that I could write up my own tracking app, because I'm not seeing anything out there that really suits my needs.  

Basically I want to track the following:
* time that I wake up or go to sleep
* time that I, what I eat, and how many calories
* times when I take my medications
* logging anything that I ingest otherwise, namely vitamins, supplements, occasional rec drugs

Beyond that I'm thinking of perhaps implementing some kind of pomodomo type thing into it, having it pop up an alert every so often, perhaps to have you click on something to rate your mood, keep some kind of historical log of what you're doing.  

Like for example, am I redditing, am I youtubing, am I educating myself about a particular topic, am I just gabbing with friends, am I writing code, am I working on music, am I playing a video game or watching tv/movie, etc.

The thing is for me I'm just at home almost all the time, I go to the gym a lot and sometimes go to some art classes and stuff, but otherwise I'm generally glued to the computer.  And I have serious ADHD so it's hard for me to keep track of time.

I don't want to be spending all my time redditing (leechblock has helped with that) or whatever other kinds of stuff, I want to be spending a % of my time working on music, a % learning, a % socializing, a % having fun...

So I'm hoping I can come up with a good way to not only track what I'm actually doing but also keep me on track with what I'm wanting to do.

I would like to share this app with others, probably freeware or donationware, so if you would like to see such an app let me know.  I would like it to be flexible enough to where one could input the things that matter to them, and make it super easy to do ubiquitous capture, while also reminding you to get stuff done.

If it becomes ""a thing"" I'm not opposed to making a web-based sync or perhaps porting to droid/ios but I'm trying to avoid allowing the entreprenuer streak in me to let loose again because I find music production much more fulfilling and fun overall than running a business.  

I just haven't found a ""killer app"" that works well for my personality type.  My IQ seems to fluxuate between 90 and 150 depending on a variety of physiological factors that I have trouble connecting the dots with.  And when my brain is working 100%, it is really hard for me to focus on anything other than being as productive on the project I'm working on as possible, to where tracking stuff seems like a nuisance.  But when I'm not at 100% then I lack the information to determine what's missing to get me back there.

If I can have an app that helps with the ubiquitous capture and formats it in a way that's useful to see long-term trends that will help a lot.  and what would be even better is if it can not only capture but also ""nudge"" me along to focus on what I need to do, or remind me of what I'm trying to do.

I am in my dietetic internship and the hospital I am working in is letting me wear a CGM through Tuesday morning. The CGM allows me to track my blood glucose levels throughout the day, and I plan on following some LG principles for a few of the days. I'll keep a food log with meals and times and should be able to provide graphs showing how my blood glucose changes during the fast, feed, and during exercise. The study is blind so I won't be able to upload results until after the trial ends on Tuesday. Here's a picture of the sensor. http://i.imgur.com/fvfJGd3.jpg

**Update**

**10/26**
So after 1 day finger sticks have showed a range of 20 points(70-90 mg/dL) so not too exiting, but all testing occurred at least 2 hrs after meals/during the fast. I'm using these tests to calibrate the CGM, so I probably won't do finger sticks when blood glucose might be changing rapidly. Diet was a little weird today due to a family party. Ill go into the details and meal timing once I have the graphs from cgm.

**Well the data has been compiled and drum roll... My pancreas doesn't wait to make insulin/my liver thinks it is cool if I run a little lean. I have many images with diets overlaid and some with average data. I was slightly hypoglycemic (<70mg/dL) almost nightly which probably has something to do with hormone levels changing during sleep and my large evening meals. Monday was a rest day/low carb day and my blood glucose dropped below 70 on 8 occasions 3-4 of which occurred after my first meal.**

I'm rather new to the field of self-quantifying, but I am already fascinated. I've always preferred SMART goals and data-driven decision processes. 

I've started using a diet tracker, a productivity tracker, a mood tracker, and I have a Jawbone UP en route. I'm aggregating my data via Tictrac.com. I'm excited to start quantitatively increasing my productivity, my mood, and my health.

Yet, as I read more content on QS, I have been noticing that almost all attention is being paid to simply quantifying and ""analyzing"" the data. But it seems that very few people are actually DOING anything about the trends and correlations in the data. It seems that there is a missing step here. What is the use of input if it produces no output? Why are tracking gadgets popping up everywhere if they aren't changing peoples' lives?

For me and my fellow newbs, please explain. Tell me how your lives have changed as a result of your data tracking. Give me your tips on getting the most out of my own data tracking.
